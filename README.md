# Description

The purpose of this script is to clean up messy desktops cluttered with screenshots.

If you, or someone you know are/is a screenshot enthusiast, have no fear, the clean-up-desktop-screenshot script is here!

This script will create a directory with the current date and move all the screenshots that are currently on the desktop, into the directory. If the directory already exists, the script will simply add files to the directory with the current date.

# How to Use

- Clone down the repo (should work anywhere on your comp)
- Using your terminal, `cd` into the repo
- Grant yourself permissions to execute this script with `chmod u+x clean-up-desktop-screenshots.sh`
- Now simply execute it using `./clean-up-desktop-screenshots.sh`
